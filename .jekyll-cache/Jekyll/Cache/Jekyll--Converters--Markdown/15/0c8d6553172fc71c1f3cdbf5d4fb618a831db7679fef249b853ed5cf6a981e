<p><img src="" alt="lg-middle" /></p>

<p>New York City has long been acknowledged as one of the centers of modernist art and culture, and incubator of the metropolitan perceptions that enabled them. It has been a key stage for what the great New York sociologist and theorist Marshall Berman called ‚Äúmodernism in the streets,‚Äù a phenomenon encompassing not only the speed and scale of modernity at large, but also the migrant communities and social movements that have staked their claims at street level and whose contributions the new modernist studies has increasingly sought to capture. From the tenements of the Lower East Side, to African-American social and artistic self-assertion in Harlem, to the spectacle of Times Square and the sweep of Broadway, to the queer life of the West Village and later Chelsea, New York‚Äôs teeming streets are where new worlds have come into being, and sites of movement where the demand for such worlds has become legible‚Äîa ceaseless process of making the city new, embodied across the long twentieth century in the competing urban visions of figures like Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs.</p>

<p>MSA 2020, ‚ÄúStreets,‚Äù will be held at Marriott Brooklyn Bridge Hotel in downtown Brooklyn, very near to the bridge that itself was rendered a modernist icon in the paintings of Italian immigrant Joseph Stella, the photographs of Walker Evans, and the poetry of Hart Crane. A separate city until 1898‚Äîif it were still separate, it would be the country‚Äôs third-largest‚ÄìBrooklyn‚Äôs adjacency to, and important differences from, Manhattan invite renewed reflection on the status of metropoles and peripheries, precisely through the ‚Äústreet-level.‚Äù As is well known, the borough whose ‚Äúample hills‚Äù were extolled by Walt Whitman has undergone a dramatic population shift since the turn of the millennium. Though Brooklyn is still a majority non-white city, gentrification has not only made parts of the borough financially out of reach for many; it has turned a borough famous for its working class (and underclass) neighborhoods into an international brand noted for its artisanal beer, designer pickles, and roof-grown lettuce.</p>

<p>The conference hotel is situated in the center of downtown Brooklyn, with myriad options for food and drink all within walking distance. The nearby subway entrances at Jay Street-Metro Tech and Borough Hall provide easy access to Manhattan‚Äôs famous monuments, architectural sites of interest, galleries, performance centers, universities, libraries, and museums.</p>

<h1 id="theme">Theme</h1>

<p>Our theme of ‚ÄúStreets‚Äù aims to foster discussion not only of modernisms that have sought to remake the streets but also those modernisms (perhaps not going by that name) that have arisen from them. It also aims to bring the study of global modernism to bear on the streets of this most genuinely global of global cities, but also on the streets that have helped to shape key moments in modernist art, from those running through the Dublin of 1904 and the London of 1922 to those spanning the Paris of 1924 and the Chandigarh of 1951. We offer ‚ÄúStreets‚Äù as a capacious rubric inviting new perspectives on modernist production and the histories that produce it. Streets can be imagined as a way of thinking; as sites of overlapping temporalities; as networks; as material, populated places; but also as infrastructure joining together remote towns and villages. The theme is thus one that not only encompasses work in literary studies, visual art and music, but also anthropology, political science, urban studies, and histories of race and immigration.</p>
