## How to submit a panel or roundtable proposal

**Please read all instructions on all pages thoroughly and with care.** The information required for submissions remains the same as in years past, though the method of entry is now different. Please consult the following guidelines when submitting your proposal.

### Step 1. Submission Deadline
Please include a 500 word abstract of the session.

### Step 4. Author Information
"Corresponding author" indicates the author who will receive e-mail communications regarding the status of the proposal. Check/uncheck this box as appropriate.

"Presenting author" is an author who presents as part of the proposed session. This option should remain checked for all participants who require a bio.

### Step 5. Topics

Please check the topic that most closely describes your proposed session.

### How to know your submission is confirmed
You will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your submission shortly after the submission process is complete.

### How to edit a proposal after you've submitted it

Please see your confirmation email from Ex Ordo for instructions on editing your submitted proposal. Proposals may not be edited once the submission deadline has passed.
