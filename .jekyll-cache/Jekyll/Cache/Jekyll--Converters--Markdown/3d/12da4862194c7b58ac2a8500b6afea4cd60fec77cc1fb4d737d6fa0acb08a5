It features a pool, fitness center, and business center, as well as a coffee shop, lobby bar, and French restaurant.  Free WiFi will be provided for all guests.  The hotel is situated in the most vibrant and dense neighborhood of Columbus, the Short North, with myriad options for food and drink all within easy access.

<p>Columbus is centrally located, within a short drive of numerous major Midwestern cities and an even shorter plane ride from much of the rest of the country.  The airport, John Glenn International, is located less than a ten-minute drive from the hotel, with taxis costing an average of $21.  Ride share options such as Uber and Lyft are also available.  A public bus, the Cota AirConnect, runs every 30 minutes and will take you to the Hilton in ten minutes for $2.75.</p>

<h2 id="getting-around-columbus">Getting around Columbus</h2>

<p>There is more than enough to entertain and absorb conference-goers within walking distance of the hotel, but the Hilton Downtown is also easily accessible to other parts of Columbus via public transit.  The Cbus, a free circulating line, takes riders through the Short North and Downtown, and from the bus line it is a manageable walk to the neighborhoods of Franklinton, German Village, and Olde Towne East.  The #2 bus line ($2.00) runs every ten minutes up and down High Street, taking only fifteen minutes to reach Ohio State.  Columbus also provides a bike rental program, CoGo, with many kiosks around the Short North, Downtown, OSU, and German Village.  Via car, all areas of Columbus are accessible within 20 minutes, with all of the neighborhoods mentioned above 5-10 minutes away.</p>
