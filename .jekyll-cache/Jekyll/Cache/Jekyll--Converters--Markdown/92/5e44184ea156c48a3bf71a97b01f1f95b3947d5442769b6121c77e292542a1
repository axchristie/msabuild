<h1 id="streets">‚ÄúStreets‚Äù</h1>

<h1 id="brooklyn-ny-october-22-25-2020">Brooklyn, NY, October 22-25, 2020</h1>

<p>New York City has long been a stage for what Marshall Berman called ‚Äúmodernism in the streets,‚Äù a modernism that encompasses not only the speed and scale of modernity at large, but also the democratic energies of diasporas, migrant communities, and social movements that stake their claims at street level. MSA 2020 will consider the modernist street as a site of movement where the demand for new worlds has become legible in countless creative ways.</p>

<p>MSA 2020 will be held in downtown Brooklyn, at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge, itself an inspiration for the painter Joseph Stella, photographer Walker Evans, and poets ranging from Hart Crane and Marianne Moore to Vladimir Mayakovsky and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. A separate city until 1898, Brooklyn‚Äôs relations with the other four New York boroughs invite renewed reflection on questions of development at street level. In particular, Brooklyn, whose ‚Äúample hills‚Äù Walt Whitman extolled, has undergone a dramatic population shift in the new millennium. Though people of color still make up the majority of Brooklyn‚Äôs residents, gentrification has not only made parts of the borough financially out of reach for many, it has also turned a borough famous for its working class and ethnic neighborhoods into an international brand.</p>

<p>‚ÄúStreets‚Äù is a capacious rubric, inviting new perspectives on modernist cultural production at a local and global scale. Streets can be imagined as a way of thinking; as sites of overlapping temporalities; as networks; and as material, populated places.</p>

<p>As part of the MSA‚Äôs initiative to promote a more diverse Association, the 2020 conference will feature five streams of interrelated interdisciplinary panels, more than any previous MSA conference. Each stream solicits proposals for individual papers and aims to draw speakers and audience members from constituencies historically underrepresented within MSA.</p>

<p>Keynote events will include a presentation by novelist Zadie Smith and a plenary roundtable on ‚ÄúThe New York Sound,‚Äù featuring Daphne Brooks (Yale), Brent Edwards (Columbia), Sara Marcus (USC), and Elena Martinez (Bronx Music Heritage Center).</p>

<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>

<p>So as to involve as many people as possible as active participants, the MSA limits multiple appearances on the program. Thus, you may participate once in each of the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¢ Seminar, either as leader or as participant</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¢ Panel or roundtable, as participant (you may also chair a different panel or roundtable)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhat Are You Reading?‚Äù session</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, you may lead a seminar, present a paper on a panel, register for a workshop, and participate in a ‚ÄúWhat Are You Reading‚Äù session, but you may not present two papers.</p>

<p>MSA rules do not allow panel or roundtable organizers to chair their own session if they are also presenting a paper or substantive remarks in the session; the session chair must be someone who is otherwise not presenting. You may chair as many sessions as you like, so long as you observe this rule.</p>

<p>Panel organizers are encouraged to identify a chair and include this information with their proposals; the MSA Program Committee can also ask another conference attendee to serve as a chair. Participation in a workshop or in a digital exhibition does not limit other forms of participation.</p>

<p>All those who attend the MSA conference must be members of the organization with dues paid for 2020-2021 (MSA membership runs from July 1 until June 30 each year) and any past dues paid in full. For information on MSA, please check the <a href="https://msa.press.jhu.edu/">Association website</a>. Unless approved by the program committee, speakers are expected to present in person, rather than remotely.</p>
