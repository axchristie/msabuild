## International Modernism Roundtable

For the first time, the MSA conference will bring together the heads of all of the world modernism organizations affiliated with the MSA: the British Association for Modernist Studies (Suzanne Hobson), the Australasian Modernist Studies Network (Lorraine Sim), and the Société d'études modernistes (Hélène Aji), as well as the president of the MSA (Laura Winkiel).  Moderated by Ignacio Infante, the panel will explore the current international state of modernist studies and share each organization's approach and perspective on the institutions of the field in different parts of the world.
