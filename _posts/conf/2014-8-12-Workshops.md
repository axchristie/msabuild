# Workshops for MSA 18

### 1. Mid-Career Modernism: Opportunities and Challenges

Organizer: Kevin Dettmar (Pomona College)

Invited Participants: TBA

Early academic career paths are fairly well mapped as we pursue tenure or the first book. We talk less explicitly about subsequent career stages. This workshop convenes engaged mid-career academics to discuss opportunities they've pursued (or consciously avoided) during this professional stage. Topics include publication, pedagogy, service, administration, and work-life balance.
 
### 2. Preparing an Effective Grant Application

Organizer: Kevin Dettmar (Pomona College)
Invited Participants: TBA

Resources to support humanities scholarship are limited, and granting agenciesâ€™ criteria sometimes opaque. Representatives from two large humanities funding agencies will talk about how to identify likely sources of support and how to write a compelling grant application.

### 3. What Do Presses Want From Your (Modernist) Book?

Organizer: Matthew Hart (Columbia University)

This workshop will bring together commissioning editors from leading university presses and series editors to address a range of practical, intellectual and professional issues involved in conceiving, writing, and proposing a monograph in modernist studies and related fields.
