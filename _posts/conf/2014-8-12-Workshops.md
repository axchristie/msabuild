### 1. Mid-Career Modernism: Opportunities and Challenges

Organizer: Kevin Dettmar (Pomona College)

Invited Participants: TBA

Early academic career paths are fairly well mapped as we pursue tenure or the first book. We talk less explicitly about subsequent career stages. This workshop convenes engaged mid-career academics to discuss opportunities they've pursued (or consciously avoided) during this professional stage. Topics include publication, pedagogy, service, administration, and work-life balance.
 
### 2. Preparing an Effective Grant Application

Organizer: Kevin Dettmar (Pomona College)

Invited Participants: TBA

Resources to support humanities scholarship are limited, and granting agenciesâ€™ criteria sometimes opaque. Representatives from two large humanities funding agencies will talk about how to identify likely sources of support and how to write a compelling grant application.

### 3. What Do Presses Want From Your (Modernist) Book?

Organizer: Matthew Hart (Columbia University)

Invited participants:<br>Philip Leventhal, Senior Editor, Columbia U. P.<br>
Douglas Mao, (Johns Hopkins University), Editor, Hopkins Studies in Modernism, Johns Hopkins U. P.<br>
Jacqueline Norton, Senior Commissioning Editor for Literature, Oxford U. P. (UK)<br>
Victoria Rosner, (Columbia University), Co-Editor, Gender and Culture Book Series, Columbia U.P.

This workshop will bring together commissioning editors from leading university presses and series editors to address a range of practical, intellectual and professional issues involved in conceiving, writing, and proposing a monograph in modernist studies and related fields.

### 4. Overcoming Writing Obstacles

Organizers: Elisabeth Joyce (Edinboro University), Katherine Fusco (University of Nevada)

This workshop will assist the early-career writer and academic in developing tools and strategies to be productive in spite of daunting impediments, such as negative criticism or heavy teaching loads.

### 5. Teaching Modernism

Organizers: Marian Eide (Texas A&M University) and Erin Hollis (California State University, Fullerton)

Modernist studies have changed radically in the last two decades with new access to unpublished and out-of-print sources, a widening geographic range, and ongoing debates regarding periodicity. How have the changes in our collective research and publication changed what we offer to students of modernism?  Have new media and teaching platforms advanced modernist pedagogy?  This workshop will produce a collaborative space in which scholars may share their pedagogical innovations and consider changes to their own curricular content or approach.
