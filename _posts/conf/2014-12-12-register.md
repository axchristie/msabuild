##Registration Rates for MSA 17

<h4 style="text-align: center">Reduced Rate: $90 / Regular Rate: $160</h4>

##Registration Process: [Online registration opens soon]()

###1. Member Number (Optional)

Please have your membership number ready if you would like the webpage to auto populate your personal information. You may find your membership number in the monthly emails JHUP sends out to you and on the paper that accompanies your issue of M/m. This is not a required step. 


###2. Address Information 

Please enter your current address information or verify that the "auto population" from the previous step is correct.

###3. Registration Rates 

Please choose the appropriate registration rate. You may pay for the conference fee and membership fee at the same time by using the "pay together" option. 

If you have already paid your membership fees for the 2015/16 year, you may select the "conference only" rate. You will be asked, however, to enter your membership number to verify your membership status. If your membership is not current, the website will not let you choose this option (you will get an error message). If this happens to you, please choose the "pay together" option or (if you feel this is a mistake) contact JHUP customer service at: 1-800-548-1784 or [jrnlcirc@press.jhu.edu](mailto:jrnlcirc@press.jhu.edu). 

All conference participants are required to pay the registration fee. There are no reduced fees for presenters/participants wishing to attend only part of the conference.

###4. Optional Business Lunch

Rate: $10

We encourage all members to attend the MSA business lunch. Prizes are awarded, Board members are introduced, and the future of the MSA is discussed at this event. Please join us!

###5. Pre-conference and Post-conference Workshops

If you are interested attending a pre-conference and post-conference workshop, which will take place prior to the conference’s opening session and after the concluding sessions on Sunday, please indicate your choice(s) when submitting your conference registration form. For the workshop schedule and descriptions, see the Workshops page on the website. If you would like to attend two workshops, please check the schedule to make sure they do not conflict. Workshops are filled on a first-come, first-served basis. Please do not register for “closed” workshops. You may check the status of workshop closings on our Workshops page. 

###6. Seminar Registration

To register, please select your top three choices when submitting your conference registration form (if your first choice is already full, you will be placed in your second choice seminar; if your second choice seminar is full, you will be placed in your third choice). Seminars are filled on a first-come, first-served basis. The deadline for seminar registration is September 1. Please do not register for "closed" seminars. You may check the status of seminar closings on our Seminars page.
