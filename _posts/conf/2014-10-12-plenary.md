## Plenary Roundtable

Our plenary roundtable will consist of a conversation among a group of esteemed scholars who explore various ways of conceptualizing the graphic: in terms of visual culture and the work of images, and in terms of the convergence of graphic aesthetics with questions of race, sexuality, and empire.

**Tsitsi Ella Jaji** is an associate professor of English at Duke University.  She specializes in African and African American literary and cultural studies, with special interests in music, poetry, and black feminisms. Her book Africa in Stereo: Music, Modernism and Pan-African Solidarity (2014) won the African Literature Association’s First Book Prize; the book traces how exchanges between African American, Ghanaian, Senegalese and South African artists shaped cultural and political liberation projects.
