## Francoise Mouly<br>"In Love with Art...and Comics"

![med right](https://lareviewofbooks.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/mouly.jpg)

Françoise Mouly may have spent her life behind the scenes but she has been a constant trailblazer when nurturing, editing and publishing most of the artists who now dominate the thriving contemporary comics scene. The editorial director of TOON Books will take us to the Soho loft where she published (and printed) the groundbreaking comics anthology RAW and is now launching a line of TOON Graphics including Hansel & Gretel by Neil Gaiman and Lorenzo Mattotti. The art editor of The New Yorker and author of Blown Covers will show how she has been creating the magazine's signature covers for over twenty years. She'll discuss how artists like Maira Kalman, Chris Ware, or Barry Blitt respond to her calls for submissions, fish for ideas, and then brace themselves for rejection. She'll reveal many of the shocking and hilarious sketches that didn't make the cut and she'll demonstrate how the magazine that exemplifies journalistic excellence in America also dares to cultivate a sense of humor when grappling with complex moral and political issues.

Françoise Mouly has been recognized as “one of the most influential editors in comics and illustration in the last thirty years,” and for good reason. Since 1993,she has been art editor at The New Yorker during which time she has overseen the publication of more than 1,000 covers. She is also the publisher and editorial director of TOON books, a comics-series for kids launched in 2008, for which she won numerous awards including the Theodor Seuss Geisel Award for “the most distinguished” book for beginning readers and the Eric Carle Museum Bridge Award for “sustained achievement in the realm of the illustrated book for young people.” Since 1980 she has also cofounded and coedited (with collaborator and husband Art Spiegelman) the groundbreaking comix magazine RAW (where Spiegelman’s Maus was first serialized); the New York Times bestselling Little Lit series; and the TOON Treasury of Classic Children’s Comics.
