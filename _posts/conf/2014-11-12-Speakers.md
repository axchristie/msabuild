## Francoise Mouly

Françoise Mouly has been recognized as “one of the most influential editors in comics and illustration in the last thirty years,” and for good reason. Since 1993,she has been art editor at The New Yorker during which time she has overseen the publication of more than 1,000 covers. She is also the publisher and editorial director of TOON books, a comics-series for kids launched in 2008, for which she won numerous awards including the Theodor Seuss Geisel Award for “the most distinguished” book for beginning readers and the Eric Carle Museum Bridge Award for “sustained achievement in the realm of the illustrated book for young people.” Since 1980 she has also cofounded and coedited (with collaborator and husband Art Spiegelman) the groundbreaking comix magazine RAW (where Spiegelman’s Maus was first serialized); the New York Times bestselling Little Lit series; and the TOON Treasury of Classic Children’s Comics.
