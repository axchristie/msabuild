## Accessibility Guide 

CART and ASL interpreters are available upon request.  Please contact the conference organizers with questions about accessibility.

A lactation room/quiet room will be provided by the hotel.

Service animals are welcomed at the hotel.  Pets are allowed with a deposit.
 
We encourage all attendees to make their presentations as accessible as possible.  Consider coming with hard copies of your talk and your presentation (including some with larger font) to distribute, encouraging attendees to request those handouts, including captions or alt-text for any images, eliminating as much technical jargon as possible, and repeating out loud questions from the audience.  More information on making accessible presentations is provided in the following PDF: [Accessible Presentation Guide](https://msa.press.jhu.edu/conferences/msa2018/assets/Preparing_an_Accessible_Presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
