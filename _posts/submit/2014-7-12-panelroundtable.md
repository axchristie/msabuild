## How to submit a panel or roundtable proposal

**Please read all instructions on all pages thoroughly and with care.** The information required for submissions remains the same as in years past, though the method of entry is now different. Please consult the following guidelines when submitting your proposal.

### Step 1. Submission Deadline
Please include a 500 word abstract of the session.

### Step 3. Topics
Please check all topics that are relevant to your panel or roundtable.

### Step 4. Author Information
"Corresponding author" indicates the author who will receive e-mail communications regarding the status of the proposal. Check/uncheck this box as appropriate.

"Presenting author" is an author who presents as part of the proposed session. This option should remain checked for all participants who require a bio.

### How to know your submission is confirmed
You will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your submission shortly after the submission process is complete.

### How to edit a proposal after you've submitted it
