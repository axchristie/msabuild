The deadline to submit workshop proposals has now passed.

<!-- 
We are not accepting workshop proposals at this time. We will begin accepting them in February 2018.

# How to submit a Pre-conference Workshop Proposal

**Please read all instructions on all pages thoroughly and with care.** The information required for submissions remains the same as in years past, though the method of entry is now different. Please consult the following guidelines when submitting your proposal.

### Step 1. Submission Deadline

Please include a brief (100 word) description of workshop purpose and format.

### Step 4. Author Information
"Corresponding author" indicates the author who will receive e-mail communications regarding the status of the proposal. Check/uncheck this box as appropriate.

"Presenting author" is an author who presents as part of the proposed session. This option should remain checked for all participants who require a bio.

### How to know your submission is confirmed
You will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your submission shortly after the submission process is complete.

### How to edit a proposal after you've submitted it

Please see your confirmation email from Ex Ordo for instructions on editing your submitted proposal. Proposals may not be edited once the submission deadline has passed.
