We recommend flying into Bob Hope Airport (BUR), which is about twenty minutes from the hotel, or Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), which is about forty minutes from the hotel. Be sure to arrange transportation from the airport; some options include taxi, private car services, and shuttle services (Westin recommends [SuperShuttle](http://www.supershuttle.com/locations/losangeleslax)), all of which are available at both airports. The one-way rate for SuperShuttle from BUR is $23, from LAX $30. Taxi from BUR will be around $60, from LAX $85. If you fly into LAX, you can take the Metro Gold Line to Pasadena for $1.50 (more info [here](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/area/transportation.html?propertyID=1453)). If you are arriving by car, click [here](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/westin/property/area/directions.html?propertyID=1453) for driving directions.
