A block of rooms has been reserved at the conference hotel, the Hilton Columbus Downtown. The special rate for members is $169 a night. The hotel, which opened only six years ago, has a dramatic interior courtyard, modern lobby design with a contemporary art collection, and distinctive rooms.  It features a pool, fitness center, and business center, as well as a coffee shop, lobby bar, and French restaurant.  Free WiFi will be provided for all guests.  The hotel is situated in the most vibrant and dense neighborhood of Columbus, the Short North, with myriad options for food and drink all within easy access. More than twenty bars or coffee shops and over fifty restaurants, ranging from many of Columbus's best to myriad inexpensive options, are located within a fifteen minute walk, with many right around the corner from the hotel.  

## Getting to Columbus

Columbus is centrally located, within a short drive of numerous major Midwestern cities and an even shorter plane ride from much of the rest of the country.  The airport, John Glenn International, is located less than a ten-minute drive from the hotel, with taxis costing an average of $21.  Ride share options such as Uber and Lyft are also available.  A public bus, the Cota AirConnect, runs every 30 minutes and will take you to the Hilton in ten minutes for $2.75.  

## Getting around Columbus

There is more than enough to entertain and absorb conference-goers within walking distance of the hotel, but the Hilton Downtown is also easily accessible to other parts of Columbus via public transit.  The Cbus, a free circulating line, takes riders through the Short North and Downtown, and from the bus line it is a manageable walk to the neighborhoods of Franklinton, German Village, and Olde Towne East.  The #2 bus line ($2.00) runs every ten minutes up and down High Street, taking only fifteen minutes to reach Ohio State.  Columbus also provides a bike rental program, CoGo, with many kiosks around the Short North, Downtown, OSU, and German Village.  Via car, all areas of Columbus are accessible within 20 minutes, with all of the neighborhoods mentioned above 5-10 minutes away.

## Restaurants

The North Market, directly across Vine St. from the Hilton, provides numerous options for breakfast and lunch.  Food stands include vegetarian, BBQ, Tibetan, Vietnamese, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern, and Polish cuisines, as well as Jeniâ€™s ice cream, coffee, pastries, and produce.  Seating is on the upper level.  Open 9-7 Monday through Friday and 10-5 Saturday and Sunday.
