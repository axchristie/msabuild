##The Guide

Welcome to an insider's guide to some of the best tastes and sights Boston has to offer. This online interactive map includes not only a selection of local food favorites (such as the best oyster spots in town), but also an extensive list of places that might be of particular interest to MSA members: nearby libraries, archives, bookstores, and literary-related historical sites. We hope you enjoy getting to know the city!

The Modernist Interactive Map of Boston is created by [Nell Wasserstrom](https://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/english/graduate/doctoral/studentemails.html).
