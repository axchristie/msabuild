**POEMJAZZ** combines spoken-word poetry and live jazz into a rich and satisfying musical conversation. Robert Pinsky, the U.S. Poet Laureate from 1997-2000), and jazz pianist Laurence Hobgood have created a jazz form in which the human voice is cast in a role like that of a trumpet or saxaphone. This duet of spoken poetry and music unites the melodies, rhythms, and images of poetry with the improvisational power of jazz.  

**Robert Pinsky** is the only poet to have served as the poet laureate of the United States for three terms. He is the author of 19 books including collections of poetry, literary criticism, and translations. A former saxophonist, the musicality of poetry is extremely important to his work, and he states that he enjoys jazz for its "physical immediacy, improvisation and also the sense that a lifetime of suffering and study and thought and emotion is behind some single phrase." Released in 2012, PoemJazz is a collaborative album combining Pinsky’s performances of poetry with Laurence Hobgood’s jazz piano compositions.

**Laurence Hobgood** won a Grammy in 2010 for Best Vocal Jazz Record, and has been nominated for a Grammy another nine-times as well. He is best known for his work with vocalist Kurt Elling. Since 1995, he’s played on, composed, arranged and co-produced all of Elling’s CDs.With Kurt Elling as well as with his own Laurence Hobgood Trio, Hobgood has performed all over the world.

Mary Manning’s *Passages from* Finnegans Wake: *A Free Adaptation for the Theatre* is a theatrical adaptation of James Joyce’s novel first performed in 1955 by the Poets’ Theater, Cambridge.  The Here Comes Everybody Players will present a staged reading of Manning’s rarely performed play that captures Joyce’s dreamlike narrative and playful language to tell the stories of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker (HCE), Anna Livia Plurabelle (ALP), and their children Shem, Shaun and Issy.

**The Here Comes Everybody Players**, whose name is based on HCE from *Finnegans Wake*, is a Boston-based theater group focusing primarily on dramatizations of the work of James Joyce.  They have performed for audiences at Dublin’s James Joyce Centre and in various Boston-area venues.  The group’s repertoire includes pieces from virtually all of Joyce's work, including *Ulysses*, *Finnegans Wake*, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, *Stephen Hero*, and *Dubliners*.

**Mary Manning** (1905 – 1999) worked as an actress, playwright, director, and literary editor in Dublin in the 1920’s and 1930’s before moving to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1935.  Drama director at Radcliffe College during World War II, she was one of the founders of the Poets’ Theater in Cambridge where her *Passages from Finnegans Wake* was first produced.  Among her many writings are three novels and the play *Go Lovely Rose*, based on the life of Rose Kennedy.  Manning’s correspondence with her childhood friend Samuel Beckett is held in the University of Texas, Austin.  She is the mother of poets Susan and Fanny Howe, and the sculptor Helen Howe.
