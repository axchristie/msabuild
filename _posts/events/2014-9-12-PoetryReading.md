# Avant-Garde Poetry Reading by the Expat Writer’s Community

![sm right](../assets/PQO.jpg)

## Friday, August 11 at 8pm

Also on Friday evening, as an alternative to our museum event at the Stedelijk, we are hosting a poetry reading featuring local expat authors writing in English. These writers are more or less loosely associated with the Amsterdam-based poetry magazine Versal, and have long been contributing to Amsterdam’s thriving expat culture. You can take a look at Versal here: [versaljournal.org](http://www.versaljournal.org/){:target="_blank"}.
