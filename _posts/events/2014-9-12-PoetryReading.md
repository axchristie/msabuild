![sm right](../assets/versal.png)

## Friday, August 11 at 8pm | Address: Singel 425

One of our Friday evening events will be introducing *Versal 12*, the literary & arts journal out of Amsterdam, with readings from *Versal* editor, Anna Arov, contributors Jane Lewty and Jing-Jing Lee, and local poet Nadia de Vries. *Versal 12* features voices and images from 15 countries, connected through diverse interpretations of the theme “migrations” in a limited edition offset print. The issue brings together the work of the writers, artists, performers, and thinkers who have shared their craft on our Amsterdam stage, as well as the prose, poetry, and art of writers and artists from around the globe, including Berlin, Dubai, Manchester, San Francisco, and Seoul.

**Jane Lewty** is the author of two poetry collections: *BravuraCool* (1913 Press: 2013) winner of the 1913 First Book Prize in 2011, and In *One Form To Find Another* (Cleveland State University Poetry Center: 2017) selected as the winner of the CSU Open Book Competition in 2016. She has co-edited two essay collections: *Broadcasting Modernism* (University Press of Florida: 2010) and *Pornotopias: Image, Desire, Apocalypse* (Litteraria Pragensia: 2009).

**Jing-Jing Lee** is the author of the novel *If I Could Tell You*. Her poems have been published in *Ceriph, Poetry Quarterly, Quarterly Literary Review Singapore*, and *Moving Words 2011: A Poetry Anthology*. Jing moved to Europe in her early 20s and started to pursue writing full- time. In 2011, she gained a Masters of Studies in Creative Writing from the University of Oxford. She now lives in Amsterdam with her husband and is working on her second book of fiction. When she’s not working on her novel-in-progress or reading (or taking photographs), she can be found here and on twitter.

**Nadia de Vries** is the author of three poetry collections, and the curator of *Sisternhood* (2016). She works at the University of Amsterdam, where she researches the aestheticization of death in web-based cultures.
**Anna Arov** is a Russian/Canadian poet and artist living in Amsterdam, where she is an editor for the literary journal *Versal* and curator of the live journal VERSO /. In addition to that, she teaches writing at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague.

## How to get there
This event takes place in a gorgeous room at the University Library on Koningsplein. The easiest (and almost fastest way to get there is, as often, to turn left after leaving our venue and walk South, on the left side of the road, past the Canal Cruise shack and the Bijzonderen Collecties until you arrive on a square, or rather crossing, full of traffic and trams, marked by a red clock tower of sorts (called De Munt in case you need to ask). There you cross the street walking towards said clock tower and walk past it, leaving it on your left. You follow the street (along the right side of a canal) which bends slightly to the right as you walk. Once you reach the next square, the Koningsplein, you have reached your destination, the UB (Universiteitsbibliotheek). The address is Singel 425. Starting time: 8 pm.
