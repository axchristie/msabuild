During the entire conference, between 9.30am and 5.30pm, the nearby museum Bijzondere Collectie grants conference badge holders free entry to its exhibition Modernism: In Print. Just stroll down the left bank of the Rokin (a few hundred metres South from our venue) and pop in for an inspiring look around in between all those panels and seminars youâ€™ll attend. You can find out more via [this link](http://bijzonderecollecties.uva.nl/en/what-s-on/next-exhibitions/next-exhibitions.html) (scroll down for a link of their Facebook page), which gives you an interesting insight into their preparations.
