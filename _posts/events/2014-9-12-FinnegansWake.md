Mary Manning’s *Passages from* Finnegans Wake: *A Free Adaptation for the Theatre* is a theatrical adaptation of James Joyce’s novel first performed in 1955 by the Poets’ Theater, Cambridge.  The Here Comes Everybody Players will present a staged reading of Manning’s rarely performed play that captures Joyce’s dreamlike narrative and playful language to tell the stories of Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker (HCE), Anna Livia Plurabelle (ALP), and their children Shem, Shaun and Issy.

**The Here Comes Everybody Players**, whose name is based on HCE from *Finnegans Wake*, is a Boston-based theater group focusing primarily on dramatizations of the work of James Joyce.  They have performed for audiences at Dublin’s James Joyce Centre and in various Boston-area venues.  The group’s repertoire includes pieces from virtually all of Joyce's work, including *Ulysses*, *Finnegans Wake*, *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, *Stephen Hero*, and *Dubliners*.

**Mary Manning** (1905 – 1999) worked as an actress, playwright, director, and literary editor in Dublin in the 1920’s and 1930’s before moving to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1935.  Drama director at Radcliffe College during World War II, she was one of the founders of the Poets’ Theater in Cambridge where her *Passages from Finnegans Wake* was first produced.  Among her many writings are three novels and the play *Go Lovely Rose*, based on the life of Rose Kennedy.  Manning’s correspondence with her childhood friend Samuel Beckett is held in the University of Texas, Austin.  She is the mother of poets Susan and Fanny Howe, and the sculptor Helen Howe.
