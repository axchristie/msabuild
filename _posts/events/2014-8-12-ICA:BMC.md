##Description

Founded in 1933 in North Carolina, Black Mountain College (BMC) was a seminal meeting place for many of the 20th Century’s most influential artists, musicians, dancers, poets, and thinkers: Anni and Josef Albers, Jacob Lawrence, Buckminster Fuller, Elaine and Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Charles Olson, Merce Cunningham, and John Cage. BMC was also a unique, interdisciplinary liberal arts college and an experimental hub for the utopian ideals of the progressive education movement. Having brought the Bauhaus experiments to American modernism, BMC has profoundly influenced art practice and pedagogy in ways that are still evident today.
