![lg left](../assets/library1.png)

From 5-7 on Thursday, during the reception prior to the Joe Sacco talk, the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and the Wexner Center for the Arts at OSU will be offering an open house and tours for attendees to visit their collections and exhibits.

The OSU Billy Ireland Cartoon Library is the largest collection of comics and cartoons in the world, and a mecca for comic artists and scholars.  It includes work by Winsor McKay, George Harriman, Bill Watterson, Will Eisner, and many others.  Highlights from the collection will be on display, and the librarians will offer behind-the-scenes tours. These will be offered continuously and will not require advance sign-up. The Billy Ireland's current exhibits are [Tell me a Story Where the Bad Girl Wins: The Life and Art of Barbara Shermund](http://cartoons.osu.edu/events/tell-me-a-story-where-the-bad-girl-wins-the-life-and-art-of-barbara-shermund/){:target="_blank"} and [Tales from la Vida: Latinx Comics](http://cartoons.osu.edu/events/tales-from-la-vida-latinx-comics/){:target="_blank"}.

The Wexner Center for the Arts will be presenting the exhibit ***Mickalene Thomas: I Canâ€™t See You Without Me*** (information [here](https://www.columbusmakesart.com/event/19324-mickalene-thomas-i-can-t-see-you-without-me)). The Wex will provide guided tours for conference attendees, one on 5:30 on Thursday during the Sacco reception, and one at 4 on Saturday.  Attendees can sign up for tours during the conference registration process.

Shuttle bus transportation for attendees will be provided from the conference hotel to the Ohio Union, where the Sacco talk will take place.  Both the Billy Ireland and the Wex are a three minute walk from the Union; volunteers will be there to guide attendees.

For those wishing to visit the Billy Ireland Library and the Wex at other times, a public bus (the #2) runs every ten minutes and takes 15 minutes from the conference hotel.
