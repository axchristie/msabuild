On the evening of Friday, August 11, the world-class Stedelijk Museum is inviting up to 250 conference participants (i.e. about half of us) to take a guided tour through their ongoing art exhibitions, which are organized around canonically modernist as well as emphatically present-day concerns, such as the refugee crisis. The tours, most of which will be given by the respective curators, begin at around 8:15, so you could begin the evening by having dinner at a nearby restaurant or at the museum restaurant itself, where we have reserved a few tables for the first arrivals. Since this event has a numbers limit (due to the limited amount of space and tour guides), you will need to sign up beforehand and get your ticket on a “first come, first serve” basis. For a preview of the exhibitions themselves, take a look at the following links.
