# Boat Tour through the Amsterdam Canals

## Thursday-Saturday

![lg right](../assets/Canals.png)

During the conference, for a maximum of 10 Euros (probably less, depending on numbers), we are organizing boat tours of ca. 1 hour along the canals of the city. This is a wonderful way of seeing the city’s historic sites and architectural gems alone or in small groups of modernist scholars. We will offer at least two opportunities for you to take such a tour every day, so there is some flexibility in timing and you won’t need to miss any particular panel in order to take part. For us to get an idea of numbers, please let us know if you are interested in taking a such boat tour at some point during the conference.
