#Dig and Be Dug in Return: A Participant Reading

##Organized by Lesley Wheeler

##Friday, Nov. 20th at 5:30 pm

The motto for this creative uprising comes from Langston Hughes, but participants wage poetic revolution under myriad banners. Please join Stephen Burt, Elisabeth Frost, Cynthia Hogue, Julia Lisella, A.L. Nielsen, Elizabeth Savage, Jennifer Scappetone, Lisa Sewell, Daniel Tobin, Donald Wellman, Lesley Wheeler, and Tyrone Williams for a celebratory reading. Each poet-scholar will read briefly from her/his own work and books will be for sale.

**I stay cool, and dig all jive,**<br>
**That’s the way I stay alive.**<br>
**My motto,**<br>
**as I live and learn,**<br>
**is**<br>
**Dig and be dug**<br>
**In return.**<br>

(Langston Hughes, “Motto.”)
