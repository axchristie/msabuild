##Saturday 21st

In the tradition of Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf, and Natalie Clifford Barney, the Modernist Studies Association would like to invite all up­and­coming scholars to participate in a ‘salon’ evening at the Boston University Pub (225 Baystate Road). Join with your fellow young scholars to ‘cover the silence’ of an evening, swapping stories, comparing notes, and enjoying, as Stein might have had she lived today, free nachos and a glass (alas) of wine.
