# Emerging Scholars Pub Night

## Thursday, Nov. 8th

## 8:30 pm

## Seventh Son Brewing, 1101 N 4th St

On Thursday Nov. 8th from 8:30-10:30 we've organized a meet-up for current and recent grad students at Seventh Son Brewing, 1101 N 4th St.  We've reserved a private room, so stop by for a beer and to chat with your fellow conference attendees.  They'll be a food truck there if you'd like to purchase something to eat. OSU grad students will also be leading an optional pub crawl from Seventh Son to other bars in the vicinity: St. James Tavern, Cosecha, Little Rock, Hoof Hearted, and BrewDog.

Seventh Son is a 25 minute walk from the conference hotel.  You can also take the free CBUS from the hotel to the 3rd Avenue stop and then walk 6 minutes.  For those coming from the Joe Sacco talk, the shuttle buses back will stop on their way to the hotel to let off passengers at 5th Avenue and High Street, a 9 minute walk to Seventh Son.
