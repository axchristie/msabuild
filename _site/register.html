<h3 id="registration-rates-for-msa-17">Registration Rates for MSA 17</h3>

<p>Reduced Rate: $90 / Regular Rate: $160</p>

<h3 id="registration-process">Registration Process:</h3>

<h4 id="member-number-optional">1. Member Number (Optional)</h4>

<p>Please have your membership number ready if you would like the webpage to auto populate your personal information. You may find your membership number in the monthly emails JHUP sends out to you and on the paper that accompanies your issue of M/m. This is not a required step. </p>

<h4 id="address-information">2. Address Information</h4>

<p>Please enter your current address information or verify that the “auto population” from the previous step is correct.</p>

<h4 id="registration-rates">3. Registration Rates</h4>

<p>Please choose the appropriate registration rate. You may pay for the conference fee and membership fee at the same time by using the “pay together” option. </p>

<p>If you have already paid your membership fees for the 2015/16 year, you may select the “conference only” rate. You will be asked, however, to enter your membership number to verify your membership status. If your membership is not current, the website will not let you choose this option (you will get an error message). If this happens to you, please choose the “pay together” option or (if you feel this is a mistake) contact JHUP customer service at: 1-800-548-1784 or <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#106;&#114;&#110;&#108;&#099;&#105;&#114;&#099;&#064;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#046;&#106;&#104;&#117;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;">&#106;&#114;&#110;&#108;&#099;&#105;&#114;&#099;&#064;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#046;&#106;&#104;&#117;&#046;&#101;&#100;&#117;</a>. </p>

<p>All conference participants are required to pay the registration fee. There are no reduced fees for presenters/participants wishing to attend only part of the conference.</p>
