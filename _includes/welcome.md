# MSA Brooklyn Rescheduled for October 2023

Dear Members and Friends,

I write regarding the planned October 2020 Modernist Studies Association (MSA) conference in Brooklyn, New York. Following extensive deliberations and a survey of members, the MSA board has determined that we cannot safely hold the Brooklyn conference in a manner that reflects our ambitions and safeguards the health of our members. We are therefore cancelling the October 2020 MSA conference.
But there is good news, too! The CFP for the Brooklyn conference generated a record number of proposals in every category. What's more, the work proposed was outstanding in its quality and diversity, representing all that is best about modernist studies in the present.

We are therefore rescheduling the Brooklyn conference for October 2023. Many of the 2020 organizers will come together again to plan this effort. And although my term as MSA president will end this fall, I will remain personally involved in making the Brooklyn conference happen.

My sincere thanks to everyone who helped plan the 2020 conference. Please join me in saluting the co-chairs: Patrick Deer, Amanda Golden, and Nico Israel. Thank you, also, to the members of the Steering Committee: Elizabeth Alsop, Emily Bloom, Bridget Chalk, Matt Eatough, Anne Fernald, Christopher GoGwilt, Jonathan Goldman, Robert Higney, Adam McKible, Julie Napolin, Vaclav Paris, and Michael Rubenstein.

If you submitted a proposal or paper to the 2020 conference, please accept my apologies. All of us on the MSA board are disappointed, too, about this outcome. We hope that you'll join us at our forthcoming conferences in Chicago, Illinois (fall 2021) and Portland, Oregon (fall 2022).

Please watch out for news about possible fall 2020 online events. While these will hardly compensate for the loss of our traditional MSA conference, we're hopeful that we'll be able to showcase at least some of the incredible work that would otherwise have been presented in Brooklyn. I'll write again on this topic in the next several weeks.


Sincerely -- and in solidarity,
Matt Hart

MSA President

# Welcome to Brooklyn

New York City has long been acknowledged as one of the centers of modernist art and culture, and incubator of the metropolitan perceptions that enabled them. It has been a key stage for what the great New York sociologist and theorist Marshall Berman called “modernism in the streets,” a phenomenon encompassing not only the speed and scale of modernity at large, but also the migrant communities and social movements that have staked their claims at street level and whose contributions the new modernist studies has increasingly sought to capture. From the tenements of the Lower East Side, to African-American social and artistic self-assertion in Harlem, to the spectacle of Times Square and the sweep of Broadway, to the queer life of the West Village and later Chelsea, New York’s teeming streets are where new worlds have come into being, and sites of movement where the demand for such worlds has become legible—a ceaseless process of making the city new, embodied across the long twentieth century in the competing urban visions of figures like Robert Moses and Jane Jacobs.

MSA 2020, “Streets,” will be held at Marriott Brooklyn Bridge Hotel in downtown Brooklyn, very near to the bridge that itself was rendered a modernist icon in the paintings of Italian immigrant Joseph Stella, the photographs of Walker Evans, and the poetry of Hart Crane. A separate city until 1898—if it were still separate, it would be the country’s third-largest--Brooklyn’s adjacency to, and important differences from, Manhattan invite renewed reflection on the status of metropoles and peripheries, precisely through the “street-level.” As is well known, the borough whose “ample hills” were extolled by Walt Whitman has undergone a dramatic population shift since the turn of the millennium. Though Brooklyn is still a majority non-white city, gentrification has not only made parts of the borough financially out of reach for many; it has turned a borough famous for its working class (and underclass) neighborhoods into an international brand noted for its artisanal beer, designer pickles, and roof-grown lettuce.

The conference hotel is situated in the center of downtown Brooklyn, with myriad options for food and drink all within walking distance. The nearby subway entrances at Jay Street-Metro Tech and Borough Hall provide easy access to Manhattan’s famous monuments, architectural sites of interest, galleries, performance centers, universities, libraries, and museums.



# Theme

Our theme of “Streets” aims to foster discussion not only of modernisms that have sought to remake the streets but also those modernisms (perhaps not going by that name) that have arisen from them. It also aims to bring the study of global modernism to bear on the streets of this most genuinely global of global cities, but also on the streets that have helped to shape key moments in modernist art, from those running through the Dublin of 1904 and the London of 1922 to those spanning the Paris of 1924 and the Chandigarh of 1951. We offer “Streets” as a capacious rubric inviting new perspectives on modernist production and the histories that produce it. Streets can be imagined as a way of thinking; as sites of overlapping temporalities; as networks; as material, populated places; but also as infrastructure joining together remote towns and villages. The theme is thus one that not only encompasses work in literary studies, visual art and music, but also anthropology, political science, urban studies, and histories of race and immigration.
